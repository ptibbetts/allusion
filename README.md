# Allusion

> Allusion is a figure of speech, in which one refers covertly or indirectly to an object or circumstance from an external context.

> It is left to the audience to make the connection.

> It is not possible to predetermine the nature of all the new meanings and inter-textual patterns that an allusion will generate.

\- says [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allusion)

Allusion is also the name of the WordPress theme in use on [my personal WordPress site](https://paultibbetts.uk).

It's a work-in-progress and [has a few things left to be completed](https://github.com/ptibbetts/allusion/issues/1) before it hits 1.0.
