# Allusion

> Allusion is a figure of speech, in which one refers covertly or indirectly to an object or circumstance from an external context.

> It is left to the audience to make the connection.

> It is not possible to predetermine the nature of all the new meanings and inter-textual patterns that an allusion will generate.

Allusion is also the name of the WordPress theme in use on [my personal WordPress site](https://paultibbetts.uk).
